# Approach:
1. The first step, *explore*, was to review the raw csv data, ingest the two files, and investigate the data within the two dataframes to identify unique regions, states, cities, retailers, and products. 
2. During the second step, *transform*, the dataframes were combined, cleaned, and column types changed as required. Furthermore, the combined dataframe was manipulated in order to provide sales insight into the top regions and retailers. 
3. The third part of the approach, *confirm*, was to validate calculations against the provided summary screenshots from the challenge module in Canvas. 
4. The last step in the approach was to *summarize and analyze*.

# Summary of Findings:
The data showed that the region/state/city with the most products sold was the Northeast/New York/New York combination with 111,954 products.
